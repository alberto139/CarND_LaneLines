Overview
---

This project is a part of the Self Driving Car Nanodegree at Udacity.com
The purpose of this project is to learn about computer vision techniques that can be useful when thinking about automating a vehicle. 

The main components of this project include detecting line segments on an image and deciding if they are part of the lane lines on the road, then extrapolating that information to draw an overlay of the lane lines on a source video.
